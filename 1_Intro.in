.h1 Intro

Most of us have sets of scripts or sources that need to be
installed on the system. This is often done via Makefiles or install scripts.
On my system, I noticed that these Makefiles follow  more or less the same
pattern. It is therefore logical to create a script that generates these
Makefiles.


Configyour does this.

Although the configyour script is extensible and provides a framework,
it is still meant for simple sets or scripts or simple generation of 
Makefiles. When you need something a bit more sophisticated, don't use
configyour.
