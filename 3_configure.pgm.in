.h1 Configure.pgm

.h2 Purpose

Configure.pgm creates the make-rules for a configuration and scripts directory.
There are three actions taken:

- The creation/update of crontabs
- Scripts are executed
- Scripts and files are placed in directories

.h2 Copy script and files

For files that contain a line with 
.fix #INSTALL@ filename
configyour will create rules that copy that file to the destination
.fix filename.

Specific owner and filemode can be set with 

.pre
#CHOWN username
#CHMOD <permission>
.pre

If there is a line
.fix #DEPENDENCY ....
in the file, the dependencies specified on that line will be dependencies in the 
Makefile for the copy. The configyour script will make no effort to create rules for the
dependency, although implicit make rules may help.
An example could be

.pre
#DEPENDENCY tag/pgm.do_me
.pre

This would force the DO_ME to run before this file is handled.

A script may also add specific rules to the makefile with  a line containing
.fix #MAKERULE <text for in the Makefile>
which could help with more complex dependencies.


.h2 Cron

Crontabs may be updated 
with files with the extension
.fix .cron
There may be different files that update different crontabs.
With a line
.fix #USER <username>
you can control for which user the crontab will be updated.
Default user is root.
The user can be in the form of
.fix user@host
and that means that configyour will create makerules with ssh 
to set the crontab for that user on that host.
The resulting makefile rules will:

- remove all lines that are tagged with the filename and username
- tag all lines with the filename and username and add the tagged lines to the crontab
- create a file with the extension .list to show that the lines are added to the crontab.

.h2 Do me

Sometimes, more elaborate installation scripts are required. Such an instalation
script can be marked with 
.pre
 #DO_ME
.pre
in the script.
